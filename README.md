# scalawave-typelevel-workshop

This repository contains slides and code from [Scalawave 2016](http://scalawave.io)
*Introduction to Typelevel (Meta)Programming with Shapeless* workshop.

You can view the slides [here](slides.pdf).

Exercises are located in the package `scalawave.exercise`, while solutions 
are at `scalawave.solution`. When solving the exercises please uncomment tests first.
Remember that when testing type-level programs, some assertions are performed at compile-time,
so when your tests are not compiling, it most probably means that they are not passing.

There are few examples of type-level programming at `scalawave.example` package.
